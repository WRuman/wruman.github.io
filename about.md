Hey! You've stumbled upon my portfolio site and (occasional) blog, where I talk
about my adventures in the land of software development. I studied Computer
Science at [Truman State University](https://www.truman.edu), attending a few
hackathons and meeting some awesome people along the way.

While at Truman, I co-founded a company with my friends 
[Nep Orshisho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neporshiso),
[Dustin Staashelm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-staashelm-19091174),
and [Phil Kegode](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-kegode-1109656b) to help students like
us find internships at companies they love. Together, we learned a lot about the
art of carefully balancing customer needs, engineering concerns, and business
requirements to make a great product.

I currently live and work in Kansas City at a cool company called
[Informa](https://informa.com), a leading provider of industry intelligence for
agribusiness, finance, pharmaceuticals, and
logistics. My team and I develop several business intelligence products,
including [SourceESB](https://sourceesb.com),
[Equipmentwatch](https://equipmentwatch.com), and
[Fleetseek](https://fleetseek.com). We're also working to migrate some of our existing codebases
onto AWS-based infrastructure, refactoring each one to make them more durable
and cheaper to run.
